# Text-emoji-Spam-Detection
This project is a Spam vs Ham (Not Spam) classifier that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple machine learning models. It also includes data visualization, exploratory analysis, and an ensemble model (SVM + XGBoost) for best accuracy.

## Text preprocessing with SpaCy (lemmatization, stopword removal).
--Handles emojis by converting them into text form.
## Multiple models trained:
  -- Random Forest
  -- Na√Øve Bayes
  -- Logistic Regression
  -- K-Nearest Neighbors
  -- XGBoost
  -- Support Vector Machine
## Visualization:
  --Word clouds
  --Bigrams analysis
  --Sentiment distribution
  --Message length distribution
## Ensemble Model (SVM + XGBoost) for improved accuracy.
## Save & Load model/vectorizer for later inference.
